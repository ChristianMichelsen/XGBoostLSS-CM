# XGBoostLSS - An extension of XGBoost to probabilistic forecasting
We propose a new framework of XGBoost that predicts the entire conditional distribution of univariate and multivariate responses. In particular, **XGBoostLSS** models all moments of a parametric distribution, i.e., mean, location, scale and shape (LSS), instead of the conditional mean only. Choosing from a wide range of continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous distribution, modelling and predicting the entire conditional distribution greatly enhances the flexibility of XGBoost, as it allows to create probabilistic forecasts from which prediction intervals and quantiles of interest can be derived.

## Available Distributions
Currently, XGBoostLSS supports the following distributions. More continuous (univariate & multivariate) distributions, as well as discrete, mixed discrete-continuous and zero-inflated distributions are to come soon.

## Some Notes
### Stabilization
Since XGBoostLSS updates the parameter estimates by optimizing Gradients and Hessians, it is important that these are comparable in magnitude for all distributional parameters. Due to variability regarding the ranges, the estimation of Gradients and Hessians might become unstable so that XGBoostLSS might not converge or might converge very slowly. To mitigate these effects, we have implemented a stabilization of Gradients and Hessians. 

An additional option to improve convergence can be to standardize the (continuous) response variable, e.g., ```y/100```. This is especially useful if the range of the response differs strongly from the range of Gradients and Hessians. Both, the in-built stabilization, and the standardization of the response need to be carefully considered given the data at hand.

### Runtime
Since XGBoostLSS updates all distributional parameters simultaneously, it requires training ```[number of iterations] * [number of distributional parameters]``` trees. Hence, the runtime of XGBoostLSS is generally slightly higher as compared to XGBoost, which requires training ```[number of iterations]``` trees only.

Please provide feedback on how to improve XGBoostLSS, or if you request additional distributions to be implemented, by opening a new issue.
